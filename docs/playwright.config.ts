/**
 * Playwright configuration for the documentation site's browser tests.
 *
 * Two projects share one browser stack and one preview server:
 *   charts - visual chart rendering, mocked against static fixture data
 *   a11y   - axe-core WCAG 2.1 A/AA scan of every page in the sitemap
 *
 * Run via the package scripts, or drive Playwright directly:
 *   pnpm run test          # both projects
 *   pnpm run test:charts
 *   pnpm run test:a11y
 *   pnpm exec playwright test --ui
 *
 * `webServer` builds before previewing so every entry point is self-contained
 * — an IDE run button or a bare `playwright test` gets a fresh build rather
 * than previewing stale output. Playwright starts `webServer` before it loads
 * spec files, so the build is also what puts `.vitepress/dist/sitemap.xml` in
 * place for the a11y project, which enumerates its pages from it at
 * collection time.
